Built during my learning journey at Axia Africa, the goal was to extract valuable business insights from raw sales data and present them through a dynamic and interactive dashboard.

# 🔍 KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS
- Which beverage brand generated the highest total revenue?

- Who are the top-performing retailers by profit and units sold?

- How does average pricing vary across beverage brands?

- What trends can be observed in monthly revenue performance?

- Which region recorded the highest beverage sales?
